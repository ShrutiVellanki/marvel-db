# Marvel DB

Marvel DB is a web application I wrote using the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/docs) in order to let users browse and lookup any character in the Marvel Universe. Users can then choose to view all Comic Books that their chosen character(s) appear in. 

Marvel DB is written using React.js 

This project is a work in progress. 

### Done: 
- Retrive all comic book characters with thumbnail, relevant information and a link to view related comic books
- Retrieve all related comic books by character ID and display them with their related thumbnial, description, and link to the official Marvel Page
- Add pagination for results
- Add routes (character page, books page, etc)

### TODO: 
- Implement search feature for characters (search by name)
- Implement sort feature for characters (sort by modified date, sort by name)
- Implement search feature for comic book results (search by name)
- Implement sort feature for comic book results (sort by modified date, sort by name)
